There are questions from two different Github sources:
- https://github.com/mateuszstompor/rhce-ex294-exam
- https://gist.github.com/waseem-h/6793ba3328f27df1a815402710acb3ff
- https://github.com/RedHatRanger/RHCE9Vagrant

Deploy the lab practice environment and attempt to answer these questions.

There are also local copies of the questions in this folder.


## Note
Where required, change the hostnames to match what is deployed in this lab e.g. 'node1.example.com'
